Image Recognition for opening mini llamas

pyautogui requires exact images to be matched

If images aren't being found, use windows snipping tool to capture the following images:
1) mini llama
2) magnifying lens (appears while hovering over mini llama)
3) right arrow to the right of "CLAIM" button (after clicking on magnifying lens)
4) "CLAIM" button

Using your resolution as the width and height, name the pics as such (ex. "claim_1920x1080"):
1) miniLlama_heightxwidth
2) miniLlamaLens_heightxwidth
3) rightArrow_heightxwidth
4) claim_heightxwidth

Place these images in the "pics" folder and pyautogui will work now.
